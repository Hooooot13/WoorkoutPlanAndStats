## 1.0.0 Warm-Up
The point of a warm up is to make sure you don't get injured. To do that a warm up need to:
 
1. Raise your heart rate and get your blood flowing. (**Cardio**)
2. Prepare your muscles to be stressed (**Functional Movement**)
 
But, a good warm up goes one step further. A good warm-up, *prepares you for the workout*. That could mean boosting your energy before the workout, or clearing your mind to help you focus.
 
A lot of people make warm-ups into games, or bike/run to the gym and do low intensity weight training to loosen up. If you have ever played a sport than you know that a lot of sport team incorporate **Dynamic Stretches** into their warm-ups.
 
Also, note that warm-ups are usually best done as a **cycle**. For a detailed explanation of cycles please see the Appendix A Section A.2.
 
 
### 1.1.0 Basic Warm-Up
 
A basic warm up has everything a warm up needs. They are bare bones, functional, and relatively quick. Basic Warm-Ups are also better for beginners or people who haven't exercised for a while. Basic Warm-Ups emphasize **simple** low intensity movements.

## Appendix A: Key Terms
### A.1 Cardio
 Cardio, or aerobic exercise, is any activity that raises your heart rate into a target range. Normally that range is 50% - 85% of the total [heart rate range](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/target-heart-rates). For more details read [this article from the mayo clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/heart-rate/faq-20057979).
 
### A.2 Functional Movements
 A Functional Movement is any workout that emulates real-life biometrics. They are useful for a workout because they are low intensity movements that your body is used to.
 
### A.3 Cycles
 
A **cycle** is when you perform every exercise in that section back to back then circle back to the first workout. For example if you were doing this hypothetical workout:
 
|**Workout**| | **Cycle**|
|:---|---:|---:|
|Exercise| Sets | Reps |
|[Pull-Up]()|10|10|
|[Push-Ups]()|10|20|
|[Squat (body Weight)]()|10|30|
 
You would do 10 Pull-Ups then, 20 Push-ups then, 30 Squats. Then you will start back at the push ups and repeat that **cycle** 10 times. When doing a cycle you can rest between each cycle but you should avoid resting between workouts. Including a cycle in your workout plan will generally move your workout closer to the **Endurance** end of the spectrum.
