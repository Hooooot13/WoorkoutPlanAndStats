## Key:

**Cycle**: Perform every exercise in that section with little or no rest then return to the first exercise. Repeat until you have completed every set of every workout in the section. Then move on to the next section. Rest only when you need to.

**Conventional**: This is a normal strength workout. Do each exercise one at a time. Rest for at least 1 minute between every set.
